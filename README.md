This library implements a nodejs module for transport of [mPlane](http://www.ict-mplane.eu/) informational elements over HTTPS.
All transaction can be secured using trusted certificates.

#REST API
The implementation has a limited set of  [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) set of messages.
In particular, for any of the mPlane informational elements, it is possible to Create and Read them between mPlane components.
